## Weeky tasks

This repo within the pands-mywork repo contains weekly tasks completed as part of the module Programming and Scripting as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analysis) at ATU Galway. These weekly tasks written in python are listed below. There is an additional Juputer Notebook (Weeky Tasks Notebook.ipynb) that has full commenting of the programs and reference to external sources to assist with the weekly tasks. 

### Repo Contents
- Week 01 - No actual file as the goal of this week was to create this pands-weekly-tasks repo.
- Week 02 - bank.py - The goal of this weekly task was to write a program called bank.py. This program should prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent, add the two amounts and lastly print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.
- Week 03 - accounts.py - Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).
- Week 04 - collatz.py - Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
- Week 05 - weekday.py - Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday (the program should be called weekday.py).
- Week 06 - sqrt.py - Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. This fucntion should be called sqrt and this function cannot use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
- Week 07 - es.py - Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.
- Week 08 - plot.ask - Write a program called plottask.py that displays a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2 and a plot of the function h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10, on the one set of axes.
